            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Finance, Business and Data senior analyst, currently pursuing my master in Data Science. 
                I have more than 7 years in the industries of logistics and agriculture. </p>

            <p>

                <li>Budget using Time Series forecasting</li>
                During my time in Geodis I was responsible of creating the volume forecasting, in order to formilize the forecasting process so 
                I implemented Time Series forecasting using an ARIMA approach to our Budget process. I also forecasted the GM, for that process
                I collected assumptions from procurement and sales teams, validated those assumptions and created different GM scenarios
                (typically a bad, normal and good scenario) to later present it to the CFO & CEO so the could present a more educated Budget.

                <li>COVID preparation</li>
                One of the main challenges I faced in Geodis was the COVID pandemic. As a BI analyst I was part of the team that gathered both
                internal and external data to create a model that evaluated different scenarios depending on variables such as 
                pandemic lenght, scale, demand volatility among others. With the analysis we could set a more robust COVID strategy both in terms
                of pricing and costing. 
                
                <li>Route optimization</li>
                In the later stages of my carrer in Geodis I worked mainly with HQ and US teams. I was a key player in a route optimization project
                that decreased the cost of the US West to US NE operations. By analizing data and applying clustering techniques I was able along
                with the operations team to identify possible routes that had enough density to consolidate cargo and apply milkruns. 
                The project had an increase in profitbaility of 500K USD in 12 months. 

                <li>Farm P&L</li>
                One of my latest experiences, NatureSweet had the necessity to integrate in single Data Warehouse data from different
                Data sources to decrease the time needed to set the P&L per farm and increase the analysis capabilities of the Finance team. 
                During the implementation I worked with the Data Engeneers to implement a solution in Snowflake to later be consumed in either
                excel or power bi by the finance team.
