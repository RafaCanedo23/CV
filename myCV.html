            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Finance, Business and Data senior analyst, currently pursuing my master in Data Science. 
                I have more than 7 years in the industries of logistics and agriculture.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tariff driven uncertainty:</strong>
                    Developed a Monte Carlo simulation model in Python, inspired by Oracle Crystal Ball, to assess the impact of a potential 25% tariff on Mexican exports. 
                    The model generated 10,000 scenarios based on probability distributions, providing key insights into EBITDA uncertainty and 
                    central metrics, empowering strategic decision-making at the executive level
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Budget using Time Series forecasting:</strong>
                    During my time in Geodis, I was responsible for creating the volume forecasting. To formalize the forecasting process, 
                    I implemented Time Series forecasting using an ARIMA approach to our Budget process. I also forecasted the GM, for which 
                    I collected assumptions from procurement and sales teams, validated those assumptions, and created different GM scenarios 
                    (typically a bad, normal, and good scenario) to later present to the CFO & CEO so they could present a more educated Budget.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>COVID preparation:</strong>
                    One of the main challenges I faced at Geodis was the COVID pandemic. As a BI analyst, I was part of the team that gathered both 
                    internal and external data to create a model that evaluated different scenarios depending on variables such as pandemic length, 
                    scale, demand volatility among others. With the analysis, we could set a more robust COVID strategy both in terms of pricing and costing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Route optimization:</strong>
                    In the later stages of my career at Geodis, I worked mainly with HQ and US teams. I was a key player in a route optimization project 
                    that decreased the cost of the US West to US NE operations. By analyzing data and applying clustering techniques, I was able, along 
                    with the operations team, to identify possible routes that had enough density to consolidate cargo and apply milkruns. The project had 
                    an increase in profitability of 500K USD in 12 months.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Farm P&L:</strong>
                    One of my latest experiences, NatureSweet had the necessity to integrate in a single Data Warehouse data from different 
                    Data sources to decrease the time needed to set the P&L per farm and increase the analysis capabilities of the Finance team. 
                    During the implementation, I worked with the Data Engineers to implement a solution in Snowflake to later be consumed in either 
                    Excel or Power BI by the finance team.
